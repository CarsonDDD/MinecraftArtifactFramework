# Minecraft Artifact Framework
---
A wip template/framework to create custom event driven(and non event driven) items called "Artifacts". I plan to add and make examples which i will use on my own server "[AlathraMC](http://www.alathramc.com/index.htm)", in the future i may remove my examples and put them in a separate project. 

</br>

## Current todo:
 - Refactor old code(alot of things i took from my other projects and only half implemented them)
 - Redo all non item based code(commands, current selection ui) 
 - Optimize event calls by creating a custom event system, which listens all Items


Current 2.0 refactor in the works
